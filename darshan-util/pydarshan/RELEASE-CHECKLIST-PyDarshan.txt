Notes on how to release a new version of PyDarshan
2020-06
-----------------------

 - Ensure python dev environment with dev dependencies, if not already present
    (- python3 -m venv venv)
    (- source venv/bin/activate)
    (- pip install -r requirements_dev.txt    # deps for packaging, testing, and docs generation)

 - Make sure documentation in docs/ is up to date
    - commit
    - make docs
    - upload docs/build/html contents to /mcs/web/research/projects/darshan/docs/pydarshan
    - (might eventually connect this with readthedocs to have this automatically uploaded)
 - Update CHANGELOG.rst
    - commit
 - Update version numbers in:
    setup.py
    setup.cfg
    darshan/__init__.py

 - Run tests with tox against different python versions
    - make test
        (may extent to test-all which would run against different python verions
        (flake8 syntax warnings can be ignored)
    - TODO: CI?

 - Submit to PyPi using twine:
    - make wheels       # requires docker, creates ./wheelhouse and builds architecture-specific *.whl that include libdarshan-util
    - make dist         # gathers relevant wheels build earlier, adds non-binary wheel and a source distribution (zip/tgz)
    - make release      # pushes contents of ./dist/* to PyPi
        (be prompted for username/password)

 - Add/update spack package: py-darshan
    - add version entry
    - add hash of release tar.gz from pypi (because that one should always exist) / or use mcs darshan mirror
    - check if new dependencies are required (compare to requirements.txt)
    - submit as pull request to https://github.com/spack/spack

 - Announce:
    - Regular Darshan Release: Copy release notes for PyDarshan and attach as seperate section (mailinglist, website/blog)
    - PyDarshan only: Post release note section of PyDarshan (mailinglist, website/blog)
    
    
    
Note on Versionsformat:
    Whenever libdarshan-utils has a version change, PyDarshan is bumped accordingly.
    4th position version numbers allows for PyDarshan to be on a faster release cycle
